# Steps to follow

It is assumed that the user has Docker installed. Installation steps for Docker can be found at "https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/".

Download folders 1_* through 6_*, as well as the "Data" folder.

Each step should be run in sequence, i.e 1_* should be run first, followed by 2_*, followed by 3_* etc.

To run each step, you should be in the directory for that step, e.g to run step one you should be in the directory 1_*.

Each step is run by executing the run_*.sh script in that step.
