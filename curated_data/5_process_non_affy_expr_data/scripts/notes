combine summaries to get unique variables
look at the data and figure out design

no of dataets and no of samples with race / IHC info

why did you include or exclude data. Very Impt!

limma 
I channel section
creating a model matrix with multile covariates (1 primary variable and a covariate)


add number of samples for race add ihc as well

describe full join step

heres what my project is
this is why its interesting

#TODO urgent

also filter metadata based on passing expresion data
new dopplegang file

make a copy of old spreadsheet 
find red entries and exclude from spreadsheet and modify special_cases scripts to remove these variables
remove extra cols from old spreadsheet.Add Y for orange cols to review with Oncologist 
export to tsv file
in R do a left_join (new_metafile, spreadsheet) by = c(Dataset_ID, VAriable)
Put back in spreadsheet
